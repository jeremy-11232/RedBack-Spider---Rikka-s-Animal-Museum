    <b style="font-size:40px"> Diet</b>
    <p style="font-size:30px"> Insects are the main diet of redback spider, it also eats large preys <br>such 
        as king cricket, male trapdoor spiders and preys on other spider’s <br> web. </p>
        
    <b style="font-size:40px">Appearence</b>
    <ul style="font-size: 30px;">
        <li> Redback spider is called as the name because there is a red dot on <br> its back,
            other parts of body are pitch black. </li>
        <li> Redback Spider have furs on its body</li>

    <h1 style="font-size: 50px;"> Why is Redback Spider not that <b style="color:red">DEADLY</b>?</h1>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;"> People are told that the redback spider is one of the most poisonous spiders in the <br>world, 
        its venom is highly neurotoxic which means the venom is attacking our nervous <br> system. 
        <br>It causes our body to feel extreme pain, and disrupts our nerve signals which <br>eventually causes paralysis and death. 
         However, my opinion isn’t nonsense. </p>
    <p style="font-size:30px"> Australia has had an antivenom for redback spider’s venom since the 1950s and Funnelweb <br>antivenom since the 1980s.<br> 
        Those antivenoms are 99.99% safe which only has a 0.01% chance that you are going <br>to die from that. However, there is someone who gets a 0.01% chance.
        Jayden Burleigh <br> who was died from a redback spider bite in Sydney in 2016, is the only one who died <br> since Funnelweb antivenom released. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">More importantly, Redback spider doesn't attack people unless they threaten it.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:30px"> Remain calm and put an ice pack on it to reduce the pain. Don't put pressure on it, the redback spider's venom spread<br>
        slowly; thus, putting pressure on it only increases the pain. It is important to get help from others and tell professionals to help; however, <br>
    in order for them to help you that you need to remain the redback spider's body and keep much visible as possible. The professional can see whether<br>
    you need or not the antivenom.</p>
